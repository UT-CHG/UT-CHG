{% include profile-short.html name="Dr Katherine A. Brown" position="University of Texas at Austin, The Oden Institute" position2="University of Cambridge, Cambridge Infectious Diseases" bio="Dr. Katherine Brown is a Senior Research Fellow currently in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK and in the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. She obtained a B.A. in Biochemistry and a B.S. in Chemistry from UT Austin and a PhD from the University of London as a graduate student in the Physics Department at Imperial College. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics. Her research interests have focused for many years on the development of translational medical applications to diagnose and treat infectious diseases. Recent studies have included the development of maps as predictive tools to provide new insights about the potential spread of neglected tropical diseases beyond the tropics. A key focus of this work is to integrate various modelling approaches used to understand the influence of climate-related events on the environment that can influence the distribution and proliferation of pathogenic organisms present in the soil, water and insect vectors.
