{% include profile-short.html name="Dr Sina Khani" position="Research Associate, The Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin" position2=""  bio="I am a Research Associate in the Computational Hydraulics Group (CHG) at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Canada in year 2015. After my PhD, I held a few postdoctoral positions: I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne (EPFL) working on atmospheric boundary layer turbulence using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (2015-2016); I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University (Princeton-GFDL) working on mesoscale eddy parameterizations in modular ocean model (2016-2019); and I was Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle working on subtropical upper-pycnocline energy distributions at North Pacific using observational data (2019-2021). My research interests include subgrid-scale parameterizations in climate models to enhance the model accuracy in capturing fundamental characteristics of sub-mesoscale, mesoscale, and large-scale motions in stratified regions, coastal area and ocean interior while the computational cost of simulations is affordable. I am currently working on hurricane predictions and storm surge modeling using large-scale atmosphere-ocean models coupled with shallow water hydrodynamics (e.g. ADCIRC model) for the coastal environment.
