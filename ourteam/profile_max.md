{% include profile-short.html name="Max Zhao" position="Graduate Student, The Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin" position2=""  bio="In the Fall of 2023, Max rode a wave of enthusiasm into the program, supervised by Prof. Clint Dawson. With interests in data-driven methods, high order numerical schemes, extreme event modeling, and hydrodynamics, it's no surprise Max grew up practically wearing flippers â€“ hailing from the south coast of China, a mere thirty-second sprint from the seashore. He LOVES playing and watching basketball during his free time.
