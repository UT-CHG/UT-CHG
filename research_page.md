**CHG's** recent efforts include investigation of high-resolution algorithms based on discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. Methodologies are being implemented and tested on a variety of computational platforms, from workstations to petascale parallel computers. The parallel simulators are scalable to tens of thousands of processors.

**CHG** researchers are part of the multi-university **[ADvanced CIRculation modeling framework (ADCIRC)](https://adcirc.org)** development team. **ADCIRC** is a modeling framework for shallow water hydrodynamics, with applications to hurricane storm surge modeling, coastal sustainability and development of hurricane protection systems, and modeling of coastal environments. In addition, the group develops "next-generation" simulators with the long-range goal of performing high-resolution, operational real-time forecasting and hindcasting.

In addition to developing numerical methods for PDEs, **CHG** performs research in data assimilation and parameter estimation, using variational methods and ensemble methods. These algorithms are also being applied to problems in groundwater and surface water.
