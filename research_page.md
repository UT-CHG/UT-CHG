FloDisMod’s long-term goal is to enhance society’s knowledge of the impact of the emergence of infectious diseases in vulnerable populations in the world’s coastal regions and provide models and maps that can be used to guide the disease management in these regions, influenced by seasonality, extreme weather, and projected climatic events, with the ultimate goal of prevention and controlling infectious diseases.

Our Research focuses on the following five arms:

* Environmental Fluid mechanics models of storm surge, coastal and riverine flow
* Geospatial Disease Data
* Geospatial Vector Data
* Social Vulnerability Data
* Community Engagement
