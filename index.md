The Computational Hydraulics Group (CHG) at the [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu) investigates the use of high-performance computing to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in environmental fluid mechanics models. We develop models and numerical methods to improve understanding of the mechanisms of flooding and storm surges involved in tightly coupled wind, waves, circulation, geomorphology, and rainfall. We develop high resolution descriptions of the physical domain and adaptively resolve energetic flow scales, and investigate accurate, robust and highly parallelizable numerical algorithms. 


The [ADvanced CIRculation modeling framework (ADCIRC)](https://adcirc.org) is a finite element coastal ocean model developed through collaboration between CHG and the University of Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, the University of Oklahoma and a number of other collaborators across the U.S. and around the world. 


The CHG also has a long history in development of discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods and its members are among the developers of the high fidelity coastal and riverine flow [Discontinuous Galerkin Shallow Water Equations Model (DG-SWEM)](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~michoski/dgswem_doc/index.html). DG-SWEM is developed as a collaboration between the CHG, Ohio State University, and the University of Notre Dame. 


In addition to these models, the CHG uses and contributes to the development of other models, including the [Adaptive Hydraulics (ADH)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/CHL/AdH/) model from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Recently, CHG researchers have developed software to couple some of the aforementioned models in an effort to maximize the exploitation of the strengths of each individual model.
