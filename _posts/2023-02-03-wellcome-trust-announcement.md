Below is the snapshot of our project in the press.

>FloDisMod – framework for flood and disease modelling
>
>Led by researchers at the University of Texas, USA, this open-source software will model floods and storm surges – particularly those occurring in the Southern Texas border region – to better understand their impact on mosquito habitat, disease reporting, social vulnerability and health risks. The team will develop an early warning system for the Texas-Mexico border region, but it will be extended to soil-borne diseases as well as other geographies.
