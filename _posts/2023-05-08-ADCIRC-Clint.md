If you want to learn ADCIRC, this will be the perfect workshop. Here is the description copied from the DesignSafe website:

>About the Webinar

>In this webinar we will discuss how to use the storm surge model ADCIRC within DesignSafe. We will discuss the latest version of ADCIRC (v55) and how to run it through the Designsafe Workspace. We will also discuss how to run it through the command line for larger jobs for those with a TACC allocation (which are available through DesignSafe). We will also discuss how to move ADCIRC output data into the data portal and discuss some recent projects with ADCIRC output data, which can be downloaded and used for research.

>Presenters

>Clint Dawson is the department chair of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at UT Austin and head of the Computational Hydraulics Group in the Oden Institute. He has over 25 years experience in storm surge modeling and high performance computing. He is on the DesignSafe Management Team.
